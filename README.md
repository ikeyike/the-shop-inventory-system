An automated image-to-inventory pipeline for diecast car collectors (Hot Wheels, Matchbox, etc.). Designed for speed, accuracy, and full automation using iPhone photos, Google Drive, OCR (Vision AI), Python scripts, and a smart Google Sheet.

## ✅ Features

- **OCR Scanning:** Extracts Toy # from the back image only, formatted as `M6916-0918K`.
- **Paired Image Processing:** Processes images in pairs (front and back) and applies the extracted Toy # to both images.
- **Organized Image Storage:** Images are renamed and moved to `organized_images/[Toy#-Variant]/`.
- **Image Conversion:** `.HEIC` → `.JPG` using macOS `sips`.
- **Duplicate Handling:** Skips images already processed and logs them as "Duplicate".
- **Unmatched Image Management:** Moves unmatched images to `/unmatched/` with logging.
- **Error Logging:** Tracks errors in `processed_images.csv` with relevant status codes.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** Updates Google Sheets with image paths and variants.

## 🚀 How It Works

### 🧾 Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Image Capture:**
   - Capture two photos per car: **front and back**.
   - Ensure the Toy # is visible in the back image.

2. **Upload to Google Drive:**
   - Upload the image pair to `TheShopRawUploads`.

3. **Processing via `ocr_batch_google.py`:**
   - Extracts the Toy # from the back image using Google Vision OCR.
   - Checks for duplicates using `processed_images.csv`.
   - Renames and organizes images in `organized_images/[Toy#-Variant]/`.
   - Logs processed images to `processed_images.csv`.

4. **Fallback Processing via `multi_image_renamer.py`:**
   - Handles unmatched or errored images using folder names as Toy # and Variant.
   - Ensures consistency in naming and organization.

5. **Data Sync with Google Sheets:**
   - `google_sheets_linker.py` updates Google Sheets with image paths, Toy #, and Variant.
